                description: `Be warned, though. This vegetarian spinach and mushroom lasagna is so good your guests may ask for it again and again — for every potluck, for every holiday feast. They'll get those puppy dog eyes when they look at you and say, "Oh, how about that veggie lasagna, it's so good, and everyone can eat it—could you bring that?" And you'll be slightly annoyed because, perhaps you were hoping to squeeze by with a simple potato salad, even though you signed up for a main. But then you'll think about how good this lasagna is and how much you want some too, and then it's just an excellent excuse to make it again.`,
